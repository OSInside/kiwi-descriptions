How to build:

    ./build

How to use:

    The image is a bootable install media ISO which installs itself
    into a ramdisk on boot. For testing several run scripts exists

    ./run_bios_as_cdrom

    ==> Boot in BIOS mode as CD/DVD

    ./run_bios_as_disk:usb

    ==> Boot in BIOS mode as disk (same as booting from USB stick)

    ./run_efi_as_cdrom

    ==> Boot in EFO mode as CD/DVD 

    run_efi_as_disk:usb

    ==> Boot in EFI mode as disk (same as booting from USB stick)

Also Interesting:

    A ramdisk deployment can also be done over the network. In this
    case the installiso="true" needs to be replaced by installpxe="true"
    and the "rd.kiwi.ramdisk=1 ramdisk_size=byte-value" boot options needs to
    be passed in the PXE config. Further information here:
